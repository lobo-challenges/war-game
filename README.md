# war-game
card problem focused on object oriented programming design

### Description 

"In War there are two players and 1 deck of cards. The cards are shuffled, and then they are dealt evenly amongst the players. These cards will make up the playerâ€™s hand. 

The game can then be played. Each player will draw one card from their hand and lay it on the table. The player who played the larger card will win the cards, and add both cards to their discard pile. If both players draw a card with the same value, give both cards to player 1 (this is a simplified version to account for time constraints). 

When a player no longer has cards in their hand, their discard pile is shuffled and moved to their hand. 

When a player no longer has cards in both their hand and their discard pile, the game is over. The player with all the cards has won and the player who no longer has cards has lost."
